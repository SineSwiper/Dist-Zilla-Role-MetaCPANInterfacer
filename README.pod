=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaCPANInterfacer - something that will interact with MetaCPAN's API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # in your plugin/etc. code
    with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaCPANInterfacer';
 
    my $obj = $self->mcpan->fetch(...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role is simply gives you a L<MetaCPAN::API> object to use with caching, so
that other plugins can share that cache.  It uses the awesome example provided in
the L<MetaCPAN::API/SYNOPSIS>, contributed by Kent Fredric.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

All of these attributes are f'ing lazy, because they like to sit around the house.
They are also read-write, as this is a role, and you might want to change around 
the defaults.

B<Type:> A caching object

B<Default:> A new L<CHI> object, using the L<CHI::Driver::File|File> driver pointing to C<<< ~/.dzil/.webcache >>>

=head1 TODO

The caching stuff could potentially be split, but frankly, none of the existing 
plugins really need caching all that much.  I've at least called the C<<< .webcache >>>
directory a generic name, so feel free to re-use it.

(Honestly, the only reason why this is a DZ module B<IS> the caching directory
name...)
